## Description

This project was created to complete the "[Project: Memory Card](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/memory-card#assignment)" from the [Javascript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The main goal of this is to use hooks or lifecycle methods as well as a lot of state. The idea for this project comes from [this site](https://www.golangprograms.com/react-js-projects-for-beginners/memory-game-in-react-js.html).
